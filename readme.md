Install using npm or yarn (I use used yarn)

Run `yarn run start`, this should open up a metro web page that lets you control your test environment. Hit the `Run in web browser` button to do what the thing says.

This will open a testing browser page that will show the app. This is running in a browser so it will look different from the app on iOS or android, but the behavior should be similar. To run it on iOS or Android click the buttons that look obvious, but you may need to install android studio or XCode (and be on a mac).

Run ` yarn prettier --write .` to get consistent style. Look up pretteir ignore if you want to overwrite the prettier logic. This doesn't run automatically right now.
